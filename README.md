## StrudelPy v0.3.7
### A tastier way to send emails with Python

### Features
* Attachments, multiple recipients, cc, bcc - the standard stuff
* Embedded Images
* Plays well with Unicode
* Easy OOP approach
* Supports Python 2 and 3 (with six)


### Setup

```
pip install strudelpy
```

### TL;DR

```
from strudelpy import SMTP, Email

smtpclient = SMTP('smtp.example.com', 456, 'myuser', 'muchsecret', ssl=True)
with smtpclient as smtp:
    smtp.send(Email(sender='me@example.com,
                     recipients=['him@example.com', 'her@example.com'],
                     subject='The Subject Matters',
                     text='Plain text body',
                     html='HTML body'))
```

### The 'Can Read' Version

Strudelpy consists mainly of two objects: `SMTP` to manage connections to SMTP
servers, and Email to encapsulate an email message.


#### SMTP

```
SMTP(host='some.host.com',
     port=465,
     username='username',
     password='password',
     ssl=True,
     tls=False,
     timeout=None,
     debug_level=None
)
```

Unless using SMTP objects with `with`, you'll need to `login()` and `close()` the connection.


#### Email

You can then send emails using the `Email` object:
```
    email = Email(sender='me@example.com,
              recipients=['him@example.com', 'her@example.com'],
              cc=['cc@me.com'],
              bcc=['shh@dontell.com'],
              subject='The Subject Matters',
              text='Plain text body',
              html='HTML body',
              attachments=['absolute/path/to/file'],
              embedded=['absolute/path/to/image/'])
    smtp.send(email)
```

Emails can use embedded images by including tags like this in the html content:

```
<img src="cid:filename.jpg">
```

Look at the tests/tests.py file for examples.


#### TLS Version
(v0.3.5): to configure the TLS protocol version, set an env variable `EMAIL_TLS_VERSION`
with either `PROTOCOL_TLSv1`, `PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1` or `PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`. The default is `PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`

#### Tests

This test suite relies on the existence of a SMTP server, real or fake to connect to.
By default it will attempt to connect to a 'fake' one that can be run using:

`sudo python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25`

Set TEST_CONFIG_NAME to one of the keys in TEST_CONFIGURATIONS to test a specific configuration


#### Still to do

* Fix tests to use a fake smtp server by default
* Your issues???

##### Motivation and Similar Projects
StrudelPy was created because I needed just that kind of functionality, in that exact way. I had an itch and my searches for a scratcher did not produce anything suitable. I took some inspiration from an older similar project of mine from way back in 2007, and [Pyzmail](http://www.magiksys.net/pyzmail/) which was nice but not as simple as I'd like to have had it. However after releasing I've found out about  [mailthon](https://github.com/eugene-eeo/mailthon) which shares the same motives and motivation behind StrudelPy. I might have not done this had I known about Mialthon.

And by the way, StrudelPy is named after the `at` sign: @, which in Israel is called "The Strudel"...
